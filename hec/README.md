#### bash-"Projects"

## Anything that requires YAD as a dependancy won't work on MacOS as only zenity is available through Brew which is in turn only available through X-Server Emulation. (unless there's a way to run YAD through that same X-Server Emulation idk since I don't have a mac, would make sense since YAD is a fork of zenity)
